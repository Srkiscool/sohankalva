          <h2>The Airbnb for Parking</h2>
          <p>
            **Update: Currently an IOS version of this application is being built out!**
          </p>
          <h3>
            Overview
          </h3>
          <p>
            When exploring a city, the problems that arise never revolve around what to do or where to go, but how to get there. All cities have some form of public transportation, but sometimes the most convenient option is to drive. However, no matter where you decide to go, whether it be a new restaurant or a sporting event, the question of “where am I going to park?” always remains. The Spotter app aims to solve this problem, by allowing users to list their driveways / parking spaces for drivers to quickly find and rent them worry free. Virtually closing the gap between homeowners who have open parking spots and drivers who are looking for parking or even cheaper parking alternatives.
          </p>

          <h3>
            Mobile Mindset
          </h3>
          <p>
            This app aims to utilize  microtasking and locality mindsets. Mobile apps excel at performing quick tasks, especially when on the move. The portability of mobile devices also allows for utilization of the device location to provide additional value and functionality.
          </p><p>
            Spotter will allow users to search for parking spots available for rent near them. By searching for parking spots near the user, locality is being leveraged to provide relevant search results. In addition, since Spotter could naturally lend itself useful to drivers, it will likely be used while driving. This makes it even more important for our app to fit into the microtasking mindset, to reduce potential distractions.               
          </p>
          <h3>
            Benefits of Mobilization
          </h3>
          <p>
            <b>Geo-Sensitivity:</b> Spotter utilizes several strengths of the mobile platform. The first and most important is geo-sensitivity. A core ability of our app is to provide users with available parking spots. Without the device’s geo location, Spotter would depend on the user for input for every search. With geo location, the app can constantly return the most relevant information without the need for user input at every step.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Communication:</b> The second mobile strength that Spotter can utilize is communication. Spotter can communicate with the user who listed his/her parking spot to alert them that a renter is approaching the spot and will arrive shortly. Similarly, the app could alert renters to parking spots that have just now become available. This two way communication provides a better experience for both users, security of mind for the lister, and satisfaction for the renter.          
          </p>
          <h3>
            Main Features
          </h3>
          <p>
            The main feature of the app for those looking for a parking space is to be able to return available parking within their area. The user can search for slots around their current location or a location of their choice. The user should also be able to filter results based on proximity, cost, and time availability.
          </p><p>
            On the other side, users looking to rent out a parking space can list their parking space. They can list their address, availability, and cost. A nice to have feature, which could could be implemented later on, would be an analytics screen to display how many guests they have had, how much money they have made, etc.               
          </p>
          <h3>
            Target Users
          </h3>
          <p>
            The application has two main targeted users: homeowners and drivers.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Homeowners:</b> This group of individuals are the group that will be providing the “product” being rented on the application. Since many of these individuals have parking spots that go unused throughout the day and sometimes much longer, they can make extra money by simply renting out their parking spaces. Ex: A homeowner in Washington DC who doesn’t own a car but has a parking spot in their driveway.
          </p><p>
            <b>Drivers:</b> This group of individuals are the main group we want to address. Drivers who travel/commute to populated locations have to end up parking in expensive parking garages and what to save money. Ex: An individual who commutes daily to Washington DC but has to pay for parking everyday in an expense parking garage.               
          </p>
          
          <h3>
            Addressed Pain Points
          </h3>
          <p>
            <b>Costly:</b> Drivers have to pay an obscene amount per month on parking and would jump at the opportunity to pay less
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Inefficient:</b> Homeowners near or in cities have parking in their homes that is not occupied for a majority of the day or not at all
          </p><p>
            <b>Not Flexible:</b> Drivers looking for parking do not want to spend extra time circling parking lots looking for a spot. This usually causes them to pay for expensive parking to save time. 
          </p>

          <h3>
            Value Provided
          </h3>
          <p>
            This application serves to provide a P2P platform which creates a new source of revenue for homeowners by creating an effortless way to rent out their unused parking spots. 
            It also creates an opportunity for drivers to find the most time saving and cost effective parking spots. 
          </p>
       
          <h3>
            Expected Life Span
          </h3>
          <p>
            This application models after Airbnb which has been around for 12 years so far and still continues to grow. Hence it is assumed that this application will at least be around 12+ years since there is always a constant need for parking as populations in crowded cities grow more and more each year.
            Spotter has great opportunity for return users since people who have rented out their parking spots once will do so again as it is almost no hassle for them. In addition drivers who have rented a parking spot in a place they commute to often will end up renting out the same spot or spots close by since these spots would be much cheaper than the alternatives. 
          </p>
